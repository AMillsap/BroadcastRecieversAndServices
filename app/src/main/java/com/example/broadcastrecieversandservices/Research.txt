1. What is the difference in an started service and a bound service?
    A started service runs until its task is complete or until it is manually stopped while a bound
    service runs until it is fully unbound from all tasks bonded to it.
2. Define what a observer/ subscriber relation is.
    A subscriber subscribes to an observer to know when data or some event has happened or changed
    that the observer is handling.
3. Define what a client/server relation is.
    A client sends data for the server to handle and after the server uses the data given it can send
    this new data back to the client or transfer the data to another client that wants it.
4. Define each of the HTTP verbs
    POST is to create a resource. GET is defined as receiving a resource. PUT replaces the resource.
    PATCH modifies the selected resource. DELETE removes the selected resource.
5. Describe at least one use for each service (Foreground, Background, Intent, Bound)
    A foreground service would be used for listening to music. A background service would be used for
    compacting data. A bound service is like a skype call where the call is always running until the
    last person leaves the call. An intent service is used for a repetitive task like a score board
    that is constantly updating.
